## The Bookmarklets

### Crosshairs

Pull up some crosshairs in order to get some precise pixel coordinates.

### Darken

Darken the page by applying a dark background and light text color. This one's kinda hit or miss depending on how a site is styled.

### Distraction-Free

Sometimes you don't want to watch a video in full screen mode, but the rest of the content on the page is distracting if you leave it small. Hide that distracting content!

Tested on Vimeo and YouTube.

### Font Inspector

Hover over some text to see what font's being used.
